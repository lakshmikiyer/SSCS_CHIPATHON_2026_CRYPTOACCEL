## Overview

CryptoAccel team is proposing a lightweight hardware accelerator implementing the **ASCON-AEAD128a** authenticated encryption algorithm, standardized by NIST (SP 800-232). It is designed for resource-constrained applications such as IoT security, secure boot, and root-of-trust.

The accelerator is built in synthesizable Verilog and taken through a complete open-source RTL-to-GDSII flow using Open-source toolchain targeting the **GlobalFoundries 180nm (GF180MCU)** process.

```

## Architecture & Design 

The design consists of three main blocks:

1. **ASCON Core (`ascon_core_adpt_encdec`)** — Implements the full ASCON-AEAD128a state machine: initialization, associated data processing, plaintext/ciphertext processing, finalization, and tag generation/verification. Supports both encryption and decryption modes.

2. **ASCON Round (`ascon_round`)** — A single purely combinational round of the ASCON permutation, comprising the round constant addition (pC), the 5-bit S-box layer (pS), and the linear diffusion layer (pL).

3. **AXI-Lite Wrapper (`ascon_axi_wrapper`)** — Provides a standard AXI4-Lite slave interface for system-level integration. A CPU or SoC master writes key, nonce, associated data, and plaintext through memory-mapped registers, and reads back ciphertext and the authentication tag.

## Design Verification  
Functional verification of the ASCON core Design Verification:
Two independent testbench approaches were used to maximize stimulus coverage:

-** Directed Verilog TB**: 7 hard-coded test cases — empty AD/PT, short and multi-block AD/PT, full encrypt→decrypt roundtrip, and a tampered-tag case that must be rejected (auth_ok=0).
- **Cocotb TB + Python golden model**: 5 categories — known-answer tests, 16-byte block-boundary edges, authentication fault-injection, 50 randomized vectors (0–256B) sweeping key/nonce/AD/PT, and 20 randomized encrypt-then-decrypt roundtrips.
- **NIST ACVP-based verification**: Following a suggestion from reviewer Luqman during the proposal review round, we incorporated NIST's Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) vectors. Using the 1089 KATs from itzmeanjan/ascon, we re-ran verification against official NIST-based test vectors — all 1089 cases passed.
- **Result**: 100% pass, 0 fails across all test cases above; the same Verilog testbench was later reused for post-synthesis GLS.

## Synthesis

Synthesized the ASCON core using **Yosys 0.64** against the `gf180mcuD` PDK via the LibreLane flow.

- **Result**: 6,298 standard cells, ~178,786 µm² area (14.78% of die).
- **Verification**: Reused the RTL testbench to run post-synthesis gate-level simulation (GLS), confirming functional correctness before physical implementation.
- **Timing-aware GLS**: Back-annotated SDF timing into the netlist and verified using Synopsys VCS (via EDA Playground) — all test cases passed.

## Physical Design — OpenROAD RTL-to-GDSII Flow  
For this tapeout, we are using an open-source toolchain to complete the RTL-to-GDS flow, following the LibreLane flow recommended by the IEEE SSCS Chipathon committee.

- Toolchain: LibreLane, a Python-based RTL-to-GDSII flow orchestrating Yosys, OpenROAD, and Magic, run via the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS Docker container (PDK: gf180mcuD).
- Setup: Docker Desktop + KLayout + Xming (VcXsrv) for GUI passthrough; flow launched via `librelane config.yaml --pdk gf180mcuD --pdk-root /foss/pdks --run-tag <tag>.`
- Current flow conditions: 50 MHz clock (20 ns period), 60% target density, 1100×1100 µm die.
- Progress: We have completed a full 80-stage run (~43 minutes) with clean DRC, LVS, antenna, and PDN signoff, and passing timing across nominal and fast corners. We are continuing to refine routing and clocking for full PVT corner closure, with additional prototyping
